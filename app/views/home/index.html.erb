  		Since submarine fibre-optic cables connect East Africa to fast, reliable and affordable Internet, the regions tech scene has been leapfrogging: from no net to mobile net in 4 years.

  		We have been working with people from all over the world, but not yet with hackers from Africa. We want to change that. We believe that it takes personal contacts to establish lasting networks. So we decided to just go there. We will meet, connect and share with our peers, bring together European and African hacking culture, and kick off continuous exchange. We will document our road trip on the web and make a movie about it.
