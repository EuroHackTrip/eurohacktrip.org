	BERLIN
	1st - 7th September
	ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
	======================

	Berlin is “a magnet for worldwide entrepreneurs and investors”, like Alexander Ljung and Edial Dekker of Gidsy. Berlin even “feels like a startup itself”.  ... Berlin has a healthy mix of early stage and late stage startups ...  Office space is cheap in Berlin.
	
	http://www.whiteboardmag.com/european-startup-hubs-compared-tel-aviv-london-paris-moscow-berlin/
	
	For years, Germany’s capital city has been an arty enclave with little or no industry. But now its startup scene is pushing hard, with a host of trendy startups and young entrepreneurs drawn in by low rents, an attractive lifestyle and easy access to Eastern European tech talent.
	
	Areas of specialty:
	
	The city’s dominant tech force remain the three Samwer brothers, who built their empire by cloning American e-commerce businesses.The city is proving strong on digital media, social games and the quirky end of the consumer web.
	
	Major funding sources:
	
	The angel network is still small, but international and European investors are increasingly drawn to Berlin, and some local VCs like Earlybird have shifted focus here from other German regions. Meanwhile, the Samwers’ Rocket Internet empire is happy to fund aggressive businesses in proven markets.
	
	Top startups:
	
	Zalando, Wooga, Soundcloud, Eyeem, Gidsy, DeliveryHero

	AMSTERDAM
	8th - 14th September
	EDUCATION
	=========

	Amsterdam is a true port city - international, tolerant and adaptable. These qualities, plus liberal tax laws, make it attractive for foreign companies. There are clear trends - 3D printing is a standout technology, from Shapeways to Ultimaker -- and fintech is a growth area. A rash of small startups have suddenly appeared, with small teams of developers building a wide range of apps and services.

	Areas of specialty:

	Varied, but particularly strong around services for creative industries like video, publishing and advertising.

	Major funding sources:

	The number of accelerators, and VC and angel investors is expanding.

	PARIS
	15th - 21st September
	FINANCIAL INCLUSION
	===================

	Many investors think Paris has seen its best days, not least because the insular environment and punative tax regime send many entrepreneurs packing. But when startups work here, they go big.
		
	Areas of specialty:

	Media, advertising, and e-commerce are strong, particularly in the segments where French brands can draw on the national obsession with haute-couture and luxury. Wireless is seeing some inventive activity too.

	Major funding sources:

	There are some large venture companies, often tied to local telcos or software companies, but local investments tend to be inwardly focused.

	Top startups:

	Criteo, DailyMotion, Deezer, Viadeo

	ZURICH
	22nd - 28th September
	SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
	=======================

	A lot of big technology companies have set up shop here. Google has set up its European engineering headquarters in Zurich, and Yahoo moved its European headquarters there from London last year. There is peripherals maker, Logitech, and even a few large, non-IT tech companies, like Tyco. They find there a plentiful supply of engineering minds, many of whom graduated from Switzerland’s equivalent of MIT, the ETH.

	Zurich now counts more than 60 technology parks and several venture funds. Swiss Start-up Monitor records 388 current startups in Zurich. http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/it-infrastructure/new-global-tech-hubs-emerge-in-surprisin/240142973


	HELSINKI
	8th - 14th September
	EDUCATION
	=========

	"They come to us and they say to us 'show us how to take over the world'," a VC said over a beer in Helsinki. In the office of cleantech startup ZenRobotics, a meeting room bears the name 'world domination'.

	Rovio, which unleashed the Angry Birds franchise on the world in 2009, is inescapable. From the airport to the Helsinki's biggest department store, Angry Birds toys, games, and other tie-ins are everywhere.

	First Slush in 2008, participants were a few hundred, and in 2003, 5,000 including investors, companies, and Finland's prime minister Jyrki Katainen. In 2014 its expected to hit 10,000. The aim of the two-day event is to get a critical mass of investors together in the region, according to Koskinen.

	Nokia’s loss may just end up being Finland’s gain. As the mobile giant slowly implodes, it is releasing batches of smart, skillful entrepreneurs into the local economy and allowing them to build interesting companies. http://goo.gl/JAFpYe

	Areas of specialty:
	Mobile is at the heart of most new businesses here, but there’s also a substantial gaming industry led by Rovio.

	Major funding sources:
	Many former Nokians are funding each other’s business ideas, and the region has good access to VC networks across Scandinavia and the Baltics too.

	Top startups:
	Rovio, Jolla, Kiosked, Steam Republic

	Notable exits:
	Innobase, Jaiku

	-------
	Finland
	-------

	From Angry Birds to Nokia castaways, Finland's startup scene has huge ambitions.  Finland is a Nordic country situated in the Fennoscandian region of Northern Europe. It is bordered by Sweden to the west, Norway to the north, Russia to the east, and Estonia to the south across the Gulf of Finland.

	As of 2013, Finland's population was around 5.5 million, with the majority concentrated in its southern regions. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. 

	Yet in 2009 Finland was second largest investor in early stage startups in Europe measured by Venture capital as a percentage of GDP. Finland's government also brought in tax breaks earlier this year for angels investing between €10,000 and €150,000 in startups.

	Tekes supports R&D in Finland by funding both companies and academic projects, and that has been financing a segment of Finland's startups it calls 'young innovative companies' (YIC) since late 2008.

	Its budget isn't small: €550m for 2013, of which a significant slice - over €100m - goes into investing in the YICs, sometimes in return for equity, sometimes in the form of a grant.
